   <div class='At'> r lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song (Hey!)
Take back my life song (Hey!)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey!)
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

No I've still got a lot of fight left in me




  This is my fight song
  Take back my life song
  Prove I'm alright song
  My power's turned on
  Starting right now I'll be strong
  I'll play my fight song
  And I don't really care if nobody else believes
  'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

  A lot of fight left in me

  Like a small boat
  On the ocean
  Sending big waves
  Into motion
  Like how a single word
  Can make a heart open
  I might only have one match
  But I can make an explosion

  This is my fight song (Hey!)
  Take back my life song (Hey!)
  Prove I'm alright song (Hey!)
  My power's turned on
  Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
  I'll play my fight song
  And I don't really care if nobody else believes
  'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

  No I've still got a lot of fight left in me
